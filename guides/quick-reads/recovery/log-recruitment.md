# Log Recruitment

**Building reliable log infrastructure by replacing potentially compromised services with verified ones.**

During recovery, Bedrock must fill [vacancy placeholders](vacancy-creation.md) in the new system architecture with actual [log services](../../deep-dives/architecture/data-plane/log.md). Unlike other recovery phases that attempt to preserve existing components, log recruitment takes an aggressive replacement approach: prioritize reliability over efficiency by using fresh services instead of salvaging potentially compromised ones.

This "clean slate" strategy works because logs contain no unique persistent stateâ€”every committed transaction exists identically across all logs in the system. The old logs contain transaction history that will be copied to newly recruited logs during the subsequent [log replay](log-replay.md) phase, but their infrastructure cannot be trusted for continued operational use.

## Three-Tier Recruitment Strategy

Log recruitment employs a systematic approach to find and assign reliable services:

**Tier 1: Service Discovery** - First, identify existing log services in the cluster that were *not* part of the failed system. These services are operational and uncompromised, making them ideal candidates for immediate recruitment.

**Tier 2: New Service Creation** - When existing services are insufficient, create fresh log workers using round-robin distribution across cluster nodes. This geographic diversity ensures that multiple node failures cannot simultaneously compromise all log infrastructure serving any particular [shard](../../glossary.md#shard).

**Tier 3: Service Locking** - Lock all recruited services (both existing and newly created) to establish exclusive control, validate operational readiness, and prevent split-brain scenarios where multiple recovery processes compete for the same services.

## Critical Error Conditions

Log recruitment implements fail-fast error handling for scenarios that compromise recovery safety:

- **Insufficient Node Capacity**: When the cluster lacks enough nodes with log worker capabilities to create required services, recovery cannot proceed safely
- **Newer Epoch Detection**: If any service reports being locked by a higher epoch number, this recovery attempt has been superseded and must terminate
- **Service Unresponsiveness**: Services that fail to respond to locking requests indicate broader infrastructure problems and trigger replacement rather than repair

## Data Flow

The recruitment process transforms abstract vacancy placeholders into concrete operational infrastructure:

- **Input**: `recovery_attempt.logs` containing vacancy placeholders like `{:vacancy, 1}` mapped to shard combinations
- **Processing**: Systematic assignment of discovered or newly created services according to the three-tier strategy
- **Output**: Concrete service identifiers replacing all placeholders, plus service descriptor mappings and process relationships for coordination

This establishes the trustworthy log foundation needed for subsequent [storage recruitment](storage-recruitment.md) and [log replay](log-replay.md) phases.
