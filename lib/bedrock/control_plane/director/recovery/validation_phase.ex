defmodule Bedrock.ControlPlane.Director.Recovery.ValidationPhase do
  @moduledoc """
  Performs final validation before proceeding to system state persistence.

  Conducts comprehensive checks to ensure all transaction system components
  are properly configured and ready for operation. This is the last opportunity
  to detect problems before committing to the new configuration.

  Validates that sequencer, commit proxies, resolvers, logs, and storage teams
  are all operational and properly connected. Checks that the transaction
  system layout is complete and consistent.

  The validation phase acts as a safety gate before the critical persistence
  phase. Any problems detected here can be addressed through recovery retry
  rather than system transaction failure.

  Always succeeds in the current implementation, serving as a placeholder
  for future validation logic. Transitions to :persist_system_state to begin
  the final persistence and testing phase.
